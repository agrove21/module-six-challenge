## Description
I built a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I used the 5 Day Weather Forecast link to retrieve weather data for cities and stored persistent data on localStorage.
-   Added the 5 Day Weather Forecast API to the site.
-   Created form inputs to search cities.
-   Updated the weather information to imperial instead of metric system.
-   Added a color to the selected search history city.

Also, I learned how to add APIs to a site and activate the API key for it.

CODE SOURCE NOTE: I worked with a tutor on this assignment.
